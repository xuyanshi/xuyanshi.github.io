They posted photos of their positive Covid tests on social media. They described their symptoms as if they were something to be celebrated: fever, cough, fatigue, body ache, loss of taste and smell.

Since the government [abruptly dropped](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/07/world/asia/china-zero-covid-protests.html) its stringent “zero Covid” restrictions last week in the face of [rare nationwide protests](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/29/business/china-protesters.html), much of the Chinese public has embraced a new life.
