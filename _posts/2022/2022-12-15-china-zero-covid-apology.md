Gripped with grief, anxiety and depression, many in China want a national reckoning over the hard-line “zero Covid” policy. Holding the government to account may be a quixotic quest.

They posted photos of their positive Covid tests on social media. They described their symptoms as if they were something to be celebrated: fever, cough, fatigue, body ache, loss of taste and smell. They talked about how wonderful it was to no longer be afraid of being sent to quarantine camps for infections and to no longer have to worry about neighbors being locked down for weeks as a result.

“Savor the moment when we are able to get sick,” an independent bookstore owner in Beijing posted on her WeChat timeline. “Let’s protect this most humble right.”

Since the government [abruptly dropped](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/07/world/asia/china-zero-covid-protests.html) its stringent “zero Covid” restrictions last week in the face of [rare nationwide protests](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/29/business/china-protesters.html), much of the Chinese public has embraced a new life. They have been eager to gain back some of their basic rights, even if it means the virus is now [spreading quickly](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/13/world/asia/china-covid-zero-beijing.html).

But beneath the relief is a collective and profound trauma that will not be easy to heal. Gripped with grief, anxiety and depression, people want a national reckoning of what went wrong. Many are now on an almost quixotic quest in the belief that the government should acknowledge its harsh policies were a severe mistake and should apologize for the harm it has caused.

Li Gongming, an art historian and a former member of a political advisory group run by the Chinese Communist Party, posted an article on the social media platform WeChat, urging the government of the southern city of Guangzhou to help heal the emotional and social wounds from the pandemic.

“The first step should probably start with acknowledging the mistake, offering condolences to the deceased and apologizing to the public,” he wrote. “It should be followed by holding people accountable and by making the government pay for compensations.”

His article, published Monday, was quickly deleted.

Another WeChat article, under the pen name “Banchizi,” urged the public to hold officials accountable for the heavy cost paid under the “zero Covid” policy, which it called “a silly farce.”

An apology might not suffice for some health officials who lied and misled the nation, the article said; they should be prosecuted.

The author urged the country to tabulate the collateral deaths — those from suicides, from medical treatments that were delayed or denied, and from accidents related to the pandemic restrictions.

China rarely releases the names and identities of the victims of tragedies thought to be connected to “zero Covid.” One such incident was when 27 people died in a [bus accident](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/21/business/china-covid-zero-policy-bus-crash.html) on their way to a quarantine facility in the southwestern province of Guizhou. Another was when 10 people perished in an apartment fire in the western city Urumqi, an event that triggered the mass street protests last month.

Tabulating their names and how they died is the “least respect we can pay to the deceased,” said the article by Banchizi.

It, too, was deleted.

Social media users called out some of the top health experts who talked up the dangers of the omicron variant to support the government’s “zero Covid” policy, only to change their messages after the 180-degree policy change. People circulated screenshots of different headlines of the official People’s Daily in recent months, joking that the newspaper is always right on the day it is published, but it contradicts itself when it’s later bound together with other editions.

People I interviewed told me that they want the government to apologize because it would offer some comfort for what they have endured.



Zhang, a college senior in eastern Jiangsu Province who asked to be identified only by her surname, has had to take more than 100 Covid tests this year and was locked down for a total of four months, including much of the fall semester. She feels depressed, finds it hard to become motivated and cries easily when reading news about Covid.
