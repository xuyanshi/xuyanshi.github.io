## [Contest](https://leetcode.cn/contest/biweekly-contest-101/)



## 1. [Form Smallest Number From Two Digit Arrays](https://leetcode.cn/problems/form-smallest-number-from-two-digit-arrays/)

Given two arrays of **unique** digits `nums1` and `nums2`, return *the **smallest** number that contains **at least** one digit from each array*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,3], nums2 = [5,7]
Output: 15
Explanation: The number 15 contains the digit 1 from nums1 and the digit 5 from nums2. It can be proven that 15 is the smallest number we can have.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [3,5,2,6], nums2 = [3,1,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The number 3 contains the digit 3 which exists in both arrays.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 9`
- `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 9`
- All digits in each array are **unique**.

### My solution during the contest (AC)

```python
class Solution:
    def minNumber(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        n1, n2 = min(nums1), min(nums2)
        if len(nums1) + len(nums2) == len(set(nums1 + nums2)):
            return min(n1 * 10 + n2, n2 * 10 + n1)
        return min(set(nums1).intersection(set(nums2)))
```



### Better Solution 1

```python
class Solution:
    def minNumber(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:
        s1, s2 = set(nums1), set(nums2)
        s = s1 & s2
        if s: return min(s)
        x, y = min(nums1), min(nums2)
        return min(x * 10 + y, y * 10 + x)
```



### Better Solution 2

```go
func minNumber(nums1, nums2 []int) int {
	var mask1, mask2 uint
	for _, x := range nums1 { mask1 |= 1 << x }
	for _, x := range nums2 { mask2 |= 1 << x }
	if m := mask1 & mask2; m > 0 {
		return bits.TrailingZeros(m)
	}
	x, y := bits.TrailingZeros(mask1), bits.TrailingZeros(mask2)
	return min(x*10+y, y*10+x)
}

func min(a, b int) int { if b < a { return b }; return a }
```



## 2. [Find the Substring With Maximum Cost](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-the-substring-with-maximum-cost/description/)

You are given a string `s`, a string `chars` of **distinct** characters and an integer array `vals` of the same length as `chars`.

The **cost of the substring** is the sum of the values of each character in the substring. The cost of an empty string is considered `0`.

The **value of the character** is defined in the following way:

- If the character is not in the string `chars`, then its value is its corresponding position (1-indexed) in the alphabet.

  - For example, the value of `'a'` is `1`, the value of `'b'` is `2`, and so on. The value of `'z'` is `26`.

- Otherwise, assuming `i` is the index where the character occurs in the string `chars`, then its value is `vals[i]`.

Return *the maximum cost among all substrings of the string* `s`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "adaa", chars = "d", vals = [-1000]
Output: 2
Explanation: The value of the characters "a" and "d" is 1 and -1000 respectively.
The substring with the maximum cost is "aa" and its cost is 1 + 1 = 2.
It can be proven that 2 is the maximum cost.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abc", chars = "abc", vals = [-1,-1,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The value of the characters "a", "b" and "c" is -1, -1, and -1 respectively.
The substring with the maximum cost is the empty substring "" and its cost is 0.
It can be proven that 0 is the maximum cost.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consist of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= chars.length <= 26`
- `chars` consist of **distinct** lowercase English letters.
- `vals.length == chars.length`
- `-1000 <= vals[i] <= 1000`



### My solution during the contest (AC)

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumCostSubstring(self, s: str, chars: str, vals: List[int]) -> int:
        cost = dict(zip(chars, vals))
        for ascii in range(97, 123):  # ord('a') = 97
            alpha = chr(ascii)
            if alpha not in cost:
                cost[alpha] = ascii - 96

        max_val = max(cost.values())
        if max_val <= 0:  # Empty substring
            return 0

        ans = res = 0
        for char in s:
            if cost[char] + res <= 0:
                res = 0
                continue
            res += cost[char]
            ans = max(ans, res)
        ans = max(ans, res)
        return ans
```

## 3. [Make K-Subarray Sums Equal](https://leetcode.cn/problems/find-score-of-an-array-after-marking-all-elements/)

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `arr` and an integer `k`. The array `arr` is circular. In other words, the first element of the array is the next element of the last element, and the last element of the array is the previous element of the first element.

You can do the following operation any number of times:

- Pick any element from `arr` and increase or decrease it by `1`.

Return *the minimum number of operations such that the sum of each **subarray** of length* `k` *is equal*.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of the array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,4,1,3], k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: we can do one operation on index 1 to make its value equal to 3.
The array after the operation is [1,3,1,3]
- Subarray starts at index 0 is [1, 3], and its sum is 4 
- Subarray starts at index 1 is [3, 1], and its sum is 4 
- Subarray starts at index 2 is [1, 3], and its sum is 4 
- Subarray starts at index 3 is [3, 1], and its sum is 4 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [2,5,5,7], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: we can do three operations on index 0 to make its value equal to 5 and two operations on index 3 to make its value equal to 5.
The array after the operations is [5,5,5,5]
- Subarray starts at index 0 is [5, 5, 5], and its sum is 15
- Subarray starts at index 1 is [5, 5, 5], and its sum is 15
- Subarray starts at index 2 is [5, 5, 5], and its sum is 15
- Subarray starts at index 3 is [5, 5, 5], and its sum is 15 
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

### My solution during the contest (WRONG)

My idea is wrong, because we can add or sub any of these numbers alternately.

```python
class Solution:
    def makeSubKSumEqual(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(arr)
        if n <= 1:
            return 0

        arr_min = min(arr)
        for i in range(n):
            arr[i] -= arr_min

        arr += [arr[i] for i in range(k - 1)]
        pre_sum = [0]
        pre_sum.extend(pre_sum[-1] + num for num in arr)

        # Make K-Subarray Sums Equal
        sums = [0] * n
        for i in range(n):
            sums[i] = pre_sum[i + k] - pre_sum[i]

        sums0 = copy.deepcopy(sums)
        add_ops = sub_ops = 0
        
        # NOTICE: It's WRONG!!!!!
        # Always add
        while min(sums) != max(sums):
            sums_min = min(sums)
            sums_max = max(sums)
            idx = sums.index(sums_min)
            for i in range(idx, idx + k):
                sums[i % n] += sums_max - sums_min
            add_ops += sums_max - sums_min

        # Always sub
        while min(sums0) != max(sums0):
            sums_min = min(sums0)
            sums_max = max(sums0)
            idx = sums0.index(sums_max)
            for i in range(idx, idx + k):
                sums0[i % n] -= sums_max - sums_min
            sub_ops += sums_max - sums_min

        return min(add_ops, sub_ops)
```

## 4. [M](https://leetcode.cn/problems/minimum-time-to-repair-cars/)

There is a **bi-directional** graph with `n` vertices, where each vertex is labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The edges in the graph are represented by a given 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes an edge between vertex `ui` and vertex `vi`. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

Return *the length of the **shortest** cycle in the graph*. If no cycle exists, return `-1`.

A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is used only once.

 

**Example 1:**

![Example 1 image](cropped.png)

```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The cycle with the smallest length is : 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 
```

**Example 2:**

![Example 2 image](croppedagin.png)

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There are no cycles in this graph.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 1000`

- `1 <= edges.length <= 1000`

- `edges[i].length == 2`

- `0 <= ui, vi < n`

- `ui != vi`

- There are no repeated edges.
