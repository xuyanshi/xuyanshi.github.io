Authorities imposed rules against ‘malicious’ price cuts but now are rethinking them, with hard-to-predict consequences for the economy

HONG KONG—China’s gigantic real estate bubble has popped, but despite[ the market’s prolonged downturn](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-economy-housing-country-garden-ea0db13f?mod=article_inline), prices still haven’t fallen much.

In part, that is because of price controls which many Chinese cities imposed on housing over the past two years to keep values stable. Now China is starting to loosen the rules—with unpredictable consequences.

Under the rules, which were applied in dozens of cities, local governments typically blocked developers of new homes from offering discounts of 10% to 15% or more on unsold properties. In some cities, officials put a floor on sale prices for existing homes as well.  

In recent weeks, articles appearing in state media have argued that it may be time to ditch the policies and some cities are starting to loosen them. On Tuesday, the southwestern city of Chengdu removed price restrictions for projects on newly sold land in central areas and scrapped government-guidance prices for existing homes.

A broader retreat from price floors could help developers to clear inventories of unsold properties and raise revenues to pay down [their sizable debts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/evergrande-scraps-35-billion-restructuring-plan-as-chinas-housing-crisis-intensifies-5c2db979?mod=article_inline), setting the stage for a potential recovery.
