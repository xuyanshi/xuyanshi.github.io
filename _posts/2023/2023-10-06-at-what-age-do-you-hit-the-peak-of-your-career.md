**Evidence from 200 Nobel laureates**



When john goodenough won the Nobel prize in chemistry [in 2019](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2019/10/12/batteries-exoplanets-cosmology-and-cell-biology-win-nobel-laurels) at the age of 97, scientists breathed a sigh of relief. Many had worried that the committee would not get around to honouring his groundbreaking work on lithium-ion batteries from 1980.

Goodenough (who died this year) was the oldest winner of the world’s foremost research prize. Usually laureates are closer to 55 when they pick up the phone to hear the welcome Swedish accent. But it can take years between the publication of a laureate’s career-defining work and recognition from the Nobel committee. At what age are they at the height of their powers?
