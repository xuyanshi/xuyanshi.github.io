What is a Disjoint set data structure?

Two sets are called disjoint sets if they donâ€™t have any element in common, the intersection of sets is a null set.

A data structure that stores non overlapping or disjoint subset of elements is called disjoint set data structure. The disjoint set data structure supports following operations:

- Adding new sets to the disjoint set.
- Merging disjoint sets to a single disjoint set using Union operation.
- Finding representative of a disjoint set using Find operation.
- Check if two sets are disjoint or not.
