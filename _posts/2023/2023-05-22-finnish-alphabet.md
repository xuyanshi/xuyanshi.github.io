## Finnish Alphabet

The following table describes how each letter in the Finnish alphabet (Finnish: Suomen aakkoset) is spelled and pronounced separately. If the name of a consonant begins with a vowel (usually ä [æ]), it can be pronounced and spelled either as a monosyllabic or bisyllabic word.[1] In practice, the names of the letters are rarely spelled, as people usually just type the (uppercase or lowercase) glyph when they want to refer to a particular letter.

The pronunciation instructions enclosed in slashes are broad transcriptions based on the IPA system. In notes, more narrow transcriptions are enclosed in square brackets.

## Finnish Pronunciation

![Finnish Pronunciation](pronunciation.png)

Finnish vowel harmony is an essential aspect of the language that affects not only the sound but also the meaning of words. The two classes of vowels, front and back vowels, must match within a word. For instance, in the word "koti" (home), both vowels "o" and "i" are back vowels, while in the word "keittiö" (kitchen), the first vowel "e" is a front vowel, and the second vowel "i" is also a front vowel. Paying attention to vowel harmony is crucial when learning to speak Finnish, as using the wrong type of vowel can lead to miscommunication. In addition to vowel harmony, Finnish has other unique pronunciation characteristics. For example, Finnish is syllable-timed, meaning that each syllable is pronounced with the same amount of time, giving the language a rhythmic and melodic quality. Furthermore, the stress in Finnish always falls on the first syllable of a word. English speakers may find some Finnish sounds challenging to master, such as the rolled "r" sound and the "l" sound pronounced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth. Additionally, Finnish has five diphthongs made up of two vowel sounds pronounced together as one sound, such as "ai," "ei," "oi," "ui," and "yi." Learning to correctly pronounce these sounds is important to improve one's spoken Finnish.
