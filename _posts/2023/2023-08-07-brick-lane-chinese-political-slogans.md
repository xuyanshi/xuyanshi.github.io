> The big red Chinese characters appeared overnight at the start of the weekend

**London's Brick Lane, well known for its street art, has become a talking point after one of its walls was covered by slogans extolling Chinese Communist Party ideology.**

Online videos showed a group of people had spray painted the big red Chinese characters on a white background overnight at the weekend.

The "core socialist values", composed of 12 two-character words, are some of the most common political slogans under President Xi Jinping's rule. Political propaganda in the form of red block characters on a white wall are a familiar sight in China.

The Brick Lane slogans have sparked debate online over whether they count as street art and how freedom of expression and political propaganda interact.

The wall has also become an arena for competing narratives - people swiftly added new graffiti criticising the Chinese government.

Some added "no" in front, or posted other messages or images taking issue with the spray-painted words. One picture shows an Â£800 fine issued on Saturday, citing "graffiti & flyposting" as offences.

Others were upset that the slogans covered up older works, [including a tribute to a well-known street artist who died](https://twitter.com/yaling_jiang/status/1688158647787085824).

The socialist slogans, first revealed by President Xi's predecessor Hu Jintao in 2012, include prosperity, democracy, civility, harmony, freedom, equality, justice, the rule of law, patriotism, dedication, integrity and friendship.
