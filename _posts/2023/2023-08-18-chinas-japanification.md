The good, bad and ugly, according to JPMorgan

The biggest question in global macroeconomics at the moment is whether China is on the cusp of a “balance sheet recession”. This sexy bit of economic jargon was first coined by Nomura’s Richard Koo to describe Japan’s lost decade(s), but is most commonly known as “Japanification”. 

It can be described simply as a protracted period of deflation, economic sluggishness, property market declines and financial stress as households/companies/governments unsuccessfully try to deleverage after a debt binge. 

Earlier this month, JPMorgan analysts Haibin Zhu, Grace Ng, Tingting Ge and Ji Yan published a fascinating deep-dive into the subject, which we have finally digested. The tl;dr is that JPMorgan’s economists see some spooky similarities between China today and Japan in the 1990s, but “enough differences to suggest the ‘balance sheet recession’ diagnosis, and policy recommendations that flow from it, is/are not correct”. 

That said, there are some aspects they highlight that actually look worse in China (a lot worse in some cases), so let’s dive in.

### The bad

Any fan of 1990s Dad Thrillers will remember Rising Sun, a film based on a book by Michael Crighton and starring Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes (it doesn’t get much more 90s than that). The subplot was America’s anxiety over Japan’s seemingly irresistible rise, which seems quaint in today’s eyes, but also very reminiscent about modern US angst over China. 

Sadly, JPMorgan doesn’t explore cinematic history in its report but notes that there are a few eerie other similarities between China’s current predicament and Japan’s in the early 90s.

> First is similarity in housing market development. As we have argued, China’s housing market correction since 2021 is not only cyclical (or policy-induced), it is also structural reflecting major changes in demand vs. supply in the housing market. This is similar to Japan’s housing market correction in the 1990s.
>
> Second is similarity in financial imbalance, i.e. the pace of increase and level of debt problem. According to the BIS, China’s total non-financial credit/GDP ratio approached 297% of GDP by end-2022, similar to Japan in the 1990s. Also similarly, debt is mainly domestic and domestic saving rate is high in both countries.
>
> The problem of population aging is also similar. The share of aged population (65 and above) was 12.7% in 1991 in Japan, similar to China in 2019 (12.6%).
>
> On the external front, Japan’s large trade surplus vs. the US led to trade conflict, as exemplified in the Plaza Accord in 1985 (5-6 years before the start of Japan’s lost decade) and US-China tariff war that started in 2018. From a broader perspective, the rise of Japan (30 years ago) and China (right now) to challenge the status of the US as the largest economy in the world is quite similar, leading to the fight-back from the US that initially focuses on reducing the bilateral trade imbalance.

### The good

But there are some important differences as well (aside from the lack of a China-focused Snipes movie). Some of these differences are actually worse in China’s case, and some are better. 

Let’s look at what JPMorgan thinks are the “good” differences, before turning to the ugly. First of them (and JPMorgan reckons perhaps the most important difference) is a much lower urbanisation ratio in China.
