The biggest question in global macroeconomics at the moment is whether China is on the cusp of a “balance sheet recession”. This sexy bit of economic jargon was first coined by Nomura’s Richard Koo to describe Japan’s lost decade(s), but is most commonly known as “Japanification”. 

It can be described simply as a protracted period of deflation, economic sluggishness, property market declines and financial stress as households/companies/governments unsuccessfully try to deleverage after a debt binge.

The tl;dr is that JPMorgan’s economists see some spooky similarities between China today and Japan in the 1990s, but “enough differences to suggest the ‘balance sheet recession’ diagnosis, and policy recommendations that flow from it, is/are not correct”.
