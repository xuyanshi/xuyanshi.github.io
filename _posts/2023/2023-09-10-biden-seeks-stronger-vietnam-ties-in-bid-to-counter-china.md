HANOI—The U.S. entered a new and strengthened diplomatic partnership with Vietnam, a country where it fought for years to prevent a Communist takeover, as Washington seeks to [counterbalance China in the region](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/as-china-risks-grow-manufacturers-seek-plan-band-c-and-d-aad7c47b?mod=article_inline).

President Biden arrived in Vietnam on Sunday to elevate the relationship between the two countries to Vietnam’s highest designation for foreign partners—a comprehensive strategic partnership—from its lowest. While it isn’t a defense alliance, it formally puts Washington at the same level as Russia and China in the eyes of the Vietnam government.

While the new status is symbolic, it is aimed at giving American companies, including defense contractors, reassurance that the recent warming relations between the U.S. and Vietnam will endure, and promote Vietnam as a dependable location for U.S. manufacturing operations abroad. It also sends a message to China and Russia, two longstanding partners of Vietnam, about the growing strength of U.S. ties.

The U.S. pledged a series of initiatives as part of the announcement, including a new partnership to expand Vietnam’s semiconductor production base in support of U.S. industry, as well as other investments in trade. High-level meetings between U.S. officials and their Vietnamese counterparts are expected to become more common.
