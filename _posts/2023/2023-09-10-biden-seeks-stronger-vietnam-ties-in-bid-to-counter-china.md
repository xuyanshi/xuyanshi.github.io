HANOI—The U.S. entered a new and strengthened diplomatic partnership with Vietnam, a country where it fought for years to prevent a Communist takeover, as Washington seeks to [counterbalance China in the region](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/as-china-risks-grow-manufacturers-seek-plan-band-c-and-d-aad7c47b?mod=article_inline).

President Biden arrived in Vietnam on Sunday to elevate the relationship between the two countries to Vietnam’s highest designation for foreign partners—a comprehensive strategic partnership—from its lowest. While it isn’t a defense alliance, it formally puts Washington at the same level as Russia and China in the eyes of the Vietnam government.

While the new status is symbolic, it is aimed at giving American companies, including defense contractors, reassurance that the recent warming relations between the U.S. and Vietnam will endure, and promote Vietnam as a dependable location for U.S. manufacturing operations abroad. It also sends a message to China and Russia, two longstanding partners of Vietnam, about the growing strength of U.S. ties.

The U.S. pledged a series of initiatives as part of the announcement, including a new partnership to expand Vietnam’s semiconductor production base in support of U.S. industry, as well as other investments in trade. High-level meetings between U.S. officials and their Vietnamese counterparts are expected to become more common.

“This trip has been a historic moment,” Biden said following talks with Nguyen Phu Trong, the general secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party. “Today we can trace a 50-year arc of progress in the relationship between our nations from conflict to normalization, to some new elevated status that will be a force for prosperity and security.”

The Vietnamese leader said that the U.S.-Vietnam partnership has grown by “leaps and bounds” and was now “elevated to a new height.”

Both countries are seeking a counterbalance to what they see as a [threat posed by China](https://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/countries-compete-to-lure-manufacturers-from-china-adf46d9a?&mod=article_inline). On Sunday, Biden reiterated that the U.S. was seeking stability in its relationship with China. “I don’t want to contain China. I just want to make sure that we have a relationship with China that is on the up and up,” Biden said.

The elevation of the U.S. relationship with Vietnam comes nearly 30 years after the countries established diplomatic ties. After the Communist victory in the Vietnam War in 1975, Washington placed a trade embargo on Vietnam that was maintained until the 1990s.

More recently, annual trade between the U.S. and Vietnam has exploded—more than doubling in the last five years—as western companies shift manufacturing from China. American companies such as Apple and Nike have expanded their production bases in Vietnam in recent years, and Intel has boosted investment in its Ho Chi Minh City plant.

“In a system like Vietnam’s, it’s a signal to their entire government, to their entire bureaucracy about the depth of cooperation and alignment with another country,” said Jon Finer, principal deputy national security adviser.

The announcement shows how the relationship between the two countries continues to warm, said Erin Murphy, senior fellow for the Asia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.

Vietnam is “one of the few countries in the region that has the same qualms about China on the national security side, but also, economically, they are one of the few places where you can scale up on manufacturing,” she said, noting Vietnam’s growth in vaccines and electronics.

Ted Osius, a former U.S. ambassador to Vietnam, said the partnership reflects a remarkable acceleration of trust given how cautious Vietnamese leaders have been about irritating Beijing.

“They decided to put aside their hesitation,” said Osius, now chief executive of the US-ASEAN Business Council, a trade group that advocates for U.S. businesses in Southeast Asia.

While the partnership doesn’t come with concrete gains for U.S. businesses, such as lower tariffs, Osius said it signals to executives that Vietnam is able to participate in sophisticated supply chains and should be considered by companies looking for factory locations outside China.

The Biden administration is seeking to deter Chinese aggression in the region by [building closer links](https://www.wsj.com/articles/janet-yellen-seeks-to-woo-chinas-neighbors-without-provoking-beijing-defd9910?mod=article_inline) with friendly Asian countries. In recent months, it has made diplomatic strides in nations that have sometimes been skeptical of U.S. intentions, expanding the [U.S. military’s access to bases in the Philippines](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-philippines-strike-military-base-deal-11675315003?mod=article_inline), agreeing to [jointly produce jet engines in India](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-offers-india-drones-jet-engines-to-lure-it-from-russia-e8b06a23?mod=article_inline) and now boosting ties with Vietnam.
