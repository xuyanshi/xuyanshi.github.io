**The House is looking increasingly divided amid talks of more aid**



When Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine’s president, arrives in Washington, DC, on September 21st he will find a changed American capital. Joe Biden’s White House and the Democrat-controlled Senate are firmly behind continuing to provide long-term assistance to Ukraine, just as during Mr Zelensky’s last visit in December. But the House of Representatives might not be as welcoming.

Controlled by Republicans since January, the lower chamber is now home to the most significant opposition to Ukraine in American politics. Although the party generally backs Ukraine’s fight for sovereignty, the data suggest an increasing number of Republican politicians could imperil future support.
