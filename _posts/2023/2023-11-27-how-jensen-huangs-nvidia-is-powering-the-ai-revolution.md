The company’s C.E.O. bet it all on a new kind of chip. Now that Nvidia is one of the biggest companies in the world, what will he do next?

> “There’s a war going on out there in A.I., and Nvidia is the only arms dealer,” a Wall Street analyst said.



The revelation that ChatGPT, the astonishing artificial-intelligence chatbot, had been trained on an Nvidia supercomputer spurred one of the largest single-day gains in stock-market history. When the Nasdaq opened on May 25, 2023, Nvidia’s value increased by about two hundred billion dollars. A few months earlier, Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s C.E.O., had informed investors that Nvidia had sold similar supercomputers to fifty of America’s hundred largest companies. By the close of trading, Nvidia was the sixth most valuable corporation on earth, worth more than Walmart and ExxonMobil combined. Huang’s business position can be compared to that of Samuel Brannan, the celebrated vender of prospecting supplies in San Francisco in the late eighteen-forties. “There’s a war going on out there in A.I., and Nvidia is the only arms dealer,” one Wall Street analyst said.

Huang is a patient monopolist. He drafted the paperwork for Nvidia with two other people at a Denny’s restaurant in San Jose, California, in 1993, and has run it ever since. At sixty, he is sarcastic and self-deprecating, with a Teddy-bear face and wispy gray hair. Nvidia’s main product is its graphics-processing unit, a circuit board with a powerful microchip at its core. In the beginning, Nvidia sold these G.P.U.s to video gamers, but in 2006 Huang began marketing them to the supercomputing community as well. Then, in 2013, on the basis of promising research from the academic computer-science community, Huang bet Nvidia’s future on artificial intelligence. A.I. had disappointed investors for decades, and Bryan Catanzaro, Nvidia’s lead deep-learning researcher at the time, had doubts. “I didn’t want him to fall into the same trap that the A.I. industry has had in the past,” Catanzaro told me. “But, ten years plus down the road, he was right.”

In the near future, A.I. is projected to generate movies on demand, provide tutelage to children, and teach cars to drive themselves. All of these advances will occur on Nvidia G.P.U.s, and Huang’s stake in the company is now worth more than forty billion dollars.

In September, I met Huang for breakfast at the Denny’s where Nvidia was started. (The C.E.O. of Denny’s was giving him a plaque, and a TV crew was in attendance.) Huang keeps up a semi-comic deadpan patter at all times. Chatting with our waitress, he ordered seven items, including a Super Bird sandwich and a chicken-fried steak. “You know, I used to be a dishwasher here,” he told her. “But I worked hard! Like, really hard. So I got to be a busboy.”

Huang has a practical mind-set, dislikes speculation, and has never read a science-fiction novel. He reasons from first principles about what microchips can do today, then gambles with great conviction on what they will do tomorrow. “I do everything I can not to go out of business,” he said at breakfast. “I do everything I can not to fail.” Huang believes that the basic architecture of digital computing, little changed since it was introduced by I.B.M. in the early nineteen-sixties, is now being reconceptualized. “Deep learning is not an algorithm,” he said recently. “Deep learning is a method. It’s a new way of developing software.” The evening before our breakfast, I’d watched a video in which a robot, running this new kind of software, stared at its hands in seeming recognition, then sorted a collection of colored blocks. The video had given me chills; the obsolescence of my species seemed near. Huang, rolling a pancake around a sausage with his fingers, dismissed my concerns. “I know how it works, so there’s nothing there,” he said. “It’s no different than how microwaves work.” I pressed Huang—an autonomous robot surely presents risks that a microwave oven does not. He responded that he has never worried about the technology, not once. “All it’s doing is processing data,” he said. “There are so many other things to worry about.”

In May, hundreds of industry leaders endorsed a statement that equated the risk of runaway A.I. with that of nuclear war. Huang didn’t sign it. Some economists have observed that the Industrial Revolution led to a relative decline in the global population of horses, and have wondered if A.I. might do the same to humans. “Horses have limited career options,” Huang said. “For example, horses can’t type.” As he finished eating, I expressed my concerns that, someday soon, I would feed my notes from our conversation into an intelligence engine, then watch as it produced structured, superior prose. Huang didn’t dismiss this possibility, but he assured me that I had a few years before my John Henry moment. “It will come for the fiction writers first,” he said. Then he tipped the waitress a thousand dollars, and stood up to accept his award.

Huang was born in Taiwan in 1963, but when he was nine he and his older brother were sent as unaccompanied minors to the U.S. They landed in Tacoma, Washington, to live with an uncle, before being sent to the Oneida Baptist Institute, in Kentucky, which Huang’s uncle believed was a prestigious boarding school. In fact, it was a religious reform academy. Huang was placed with a seventeen-year-old roommate. On their first night together, the older boy lifted his shirt to show Huang the numerous places where he’d been stabbed in fights. “Every student smoked, and I think I was the only boy at the school without a pocketknife,” Huang told me. His roommate was illiterate; in exchange for teaching him to read, Huang said, “he taught me how to bench-press. I ended up doing a hundred pushups every night before bed.”

Although Huang lived at the academy, he was too young to attend its classes, so he went to a nearby public school. There, he befriended Ben Bays, who lived with his five siblings in an old house with no running water. “Most of the kids at the school were children of tobacco farmers,” Bays said, “or just poor kids living in the mouth of the holler.” Huang arrived with the school year already in session, and Bays remembers the principal introducing an undersized Asian immigrant with long hair and heavily accented English. “He was a perfect target,” Bays said.

Huang was relentlessly bullied. “The way you described Chinese people back then was ‘Chinks,’ ” Huang told me, with no apparent emotion. “We were called that every day.” To get to school, Huang had to cross a rickety pedestrian footbridge over a river. “These swinging bridges, they were very high,” Bays said. “It was old planks, and most of them were missing.” Sometimes, when Huang was crossing the bridge, the local boys would grab the ropes and try to dislodge him. “Somehow it never seemed to affect him,” Bays said. “He just shook it off.” By the end of the school year, Bays told me, Huang was leading those same kids on adventures into the woods. Bays recalled how carefully Huang stepped around the missing planks. “Actually, it looked like he was having fun,” he said.

Huang credits his time at Oneida with building resiliency. “Back then, there wasn’t a counsellor to talk to,” he told me. “Back then, you just had to toughen up and move on.” In 2019, he donated a building to the school, and talked fondly of the (now gone) footbridge, neglecting to mention the bullies who had tried to toss him off it.

After a couple of years, Huang’s parents secured entry to the United States, settling in Oregon, and the brothers reunited with them. Huang excelled in high school, and was a nationally ranked table-tennis player. He belonged to the school’s math, computer, and science clubs, skipped two grades, and graduated when he was sixteen. “I did not have a girlfriend,” he said.

Huang attended Oregon State University, where he majored in electrical engineering. His lab partner in his introductory classes was Lori Mills, an earnest, nerdy undergraduate with curly brown hair. “There were, like, two hundred and fifty kids in electrical engineering, and maybe three girls,” Huang told me. Competition broke out among the male undergraduates for Mills’s attention, and Huang felt that he was at a disadvantage. “I was the youngest kid in the class,” he said. “I looked like I was about twelve.”

Every weekend, Huang would call Mills and pester her to do homework with him. “I tried to impress her—not with my looks, of course, but with my strong capability to complete homework,” he said. Mills accepted, and, after six months of homework, Huang worked up the courage to ask her out on a date. She accepted that offer, too.

Following graduation, Huang and Mills found work in Silicon Valley as microchip designers. (“She actually made more than me,” Huang said.) The two got married, and within a few years Mills had left the workforce to bring up their children. By then, Huang was running his own division, and attending graduate school at Stanford by night. He founded Nvidia in 1993, with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, two veteran microchip designers. Although Huang, then thirty, was younger than Malachowsky and Priem, both felt that he was ready to be C.E.O. “He was a fast learner,” Malachowsky said.

Malachowsky and Priem were looking to design a graphics chip, which they hoped would make competitors, in Priem’s words, “green with envy.” They called their company NVision, until they learned that the name was taken by a manufacturer of toilet paper. Huang suggested Nvidia, riffing on the Latin word *invidia*, meaning “envy.” He selected the Denny’s as a venue to organize the business because it was quieter than home and had cheap coffee—and also because of his experience working for the restaurant chain in Oregon in the nineteen-eighties. “I find that I think best when I’m under adversity,” Huang said. “My heart rate actually goes down. Anyone who’s dealt with rush hour in a restaurant knows what I’m talking about.”

Huang liked video games and thought that there was a market for better graphics chips. Instead of drawing pixels by hand, artists were starting to assemble three-dimensional polygons out of shapes known as “primitives,” saving time and effort but requiring new chips. Nvidia’s competitors’ primitives used triangles, but Huang and his co-founders decided to use quadrilaterals instead. This was a mistake, and it nearly sank the company: soon after the release of Nvidia’s first product, Microsoft announced that its graphics software would support only triangles.

Short on money, Huang decided that his only hope was to use the conventional triangle approach and try to beat the competition to market. In 1996, he laid off more than half the hundred people working at Nvidia, then bet the company’s remaining funds on a production run of untested microchips that he wasn’t sure would work. “It was fifty-fifty,” Huang told me, “but we were going out of business anyway.”

When the product, known as *riva* 128, hit stores, Nvidia had enough money to meet only one month of payroll. But the gamble paid off, and Nvidia sold a million *riva*s in four months. Huang encouraged his employees to continue shipping products with a sense of desperation, and for years to come he opened staff presentations with the words “Our company is thirty days from going out of business.” The phrase remains the unofficial corporate motto.
