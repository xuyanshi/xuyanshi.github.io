The island democracy draws two opposite lessons from Russian invasion of Ukraine

TAIPEI, Taiwan—People in Taiwan have been following every twist of the war in Ukraine. But, while their sympathy for the Ukrainian cause is near-universal, the conclusions for the island’s own future widely diverge.

To some, the takeaway is that even a seemingly invincible foe can be defeated if a society stands firm, an inspiration for Taiwan’s own effort to resist [a feared invasion by China](https://www.wsj.com/story/as-china-warns-taiwan-heres-where-frictions-stand-05c9cba2?mod=article_inline). Others draw the opposite lesson from the images of smoldering Ukrainian cities. Anything is better than war, they say, and Taiwan should do all it can to avoid provoking Beijing’s wrath, even if that means painful compromises.

These two competing visions will play out in [Taiwan’s presidential elections](https://www.wsj.com/articles/taiwan-opposition-taps-popular-former-cop-in-election-thats-pivotal-for-u-s-china-b59f81bd?mod=article_inline), slated for January, and shape how the island democracy revamps its defenses as China’s military might expands. The soul-searching inside Taiwan, and the determination with which it will strengthen its armed forces, is also bound to affect the extent to which the U.S. will get involved militarily should Beijing try to capture the island, home to 24 million people—and most of the world’s advanced semiconductor production capacity.

While Taiwan has been living under a threat of invasion ever since China’s Communist Party took control of the mainland in 1949, the Russian thrust into Ukraine drove home to many Taiwanese that war can erupt with little notice. Chinese leaders have intensified their rhetoric around Taiwan, repeating that they won’t rule out using force to achieve what they call “national reunification.” Beijing has also ramped up naval and air probes around the island that wear out Taiwanese defenses. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency estimates that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has set 2027 as the deadline for his military to be ready to take the island.

“What Ukraine has underscored is that it’s not a remote possibility that an aggressive neighbor can unilaterally decide to take action against you. It’s a wake-up call,” said Enoch Wu, founder of the Forward Alliance, a nongovernmental organization that has started training Taiwanese civilians in emergency response and first aid. “The threat that we face is an existential one, and so our defense mission has got to involve the entire society.”

Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen has already moved to [increase the length of compulsory military service](https://www.wsj.com/articles/taiwan-to-extend-mandatory-military-service-11672129529?mod=article_inline) starting next year, to one year from four months, and is boosting military spending as Taipei purchases new weapons from the U.S., such as hundreds of Harpoon antiship missiles. While Tsai isn’t eligible to run again, the presidential candidate from her ruling party—current Vice President Lai Ching-te—has similarly pledged to safeguard the island’s autonomy and resist Beijing’s growing intimidation.

“I don’t think anybody rational could look at this and say dialogue is going to change Xi or the CCP,” said Vincent Chao, a former national-security official and Lai’s spokesman, referring to China’s Communist Party. “They see the subjugation of Taiwan as part of their national rejuvenation, as something inherently connected to their political legitimacy. It’s incumbent upon any candidate to be realistic about the situation.” Ukraine, he added, has given Taiwan a “brilliant lesson” in how to defend itself—and how to build coalitions with like-minded democracies.

The main opposition Nationalist Party, known as the Kuomintang, holds a different view. “We want to talk to the Chinese. We believe that we can have a dialogue with the Chinese. That will certainly de-escalate the tension, to make sure no accidental war, and for sure no intentional war, happens,” Kuomintang vice chairman Andrew Hsia said in an interview before departing on a trip to China in June, his second this year. 

Ukraine’s tragedy has made an outreach to Beijing even more vital, he added: “In the past we talked about war, but now for the first time we saw in our living rooms, on television, all this destruction. Are we ready for that? I don’t think we are, I don’t think we are that resilient.”

The Kuomintang’s presidential candidate, Hou Yu-ih, pledged this week that he would return the compulsory military service length to four months after improving ties with Beijing.

While the Kuomintang performed well during local elections last fall, opinion polls so far show Lai in the lead, though the presidential race is too volatile to call. A third candidate, Ko Wen-je, the centrist former mayor of Taipei, is also polling high, further confounding predictions. 

Chinese leaders have watched with alarm how the Russian military stumbled in Ukraine, suffering high casualties and a series of setbacks that helped trigger the [brief mutiny by the Wagner paramilitary group](https://www.wsj.com/articles/putins-war-on-ukraine-backfires-leading-to-wagner-uprising-at-home-6530de71?mod=article_inline) last month. But there is no indication that Xi, who has already squelched the autonomy and civil liberties enjoyed by Hong Kong, has become less determined to take Taiwan because of Russia’s difficulties, U.S. officials say.

A formidable natural barrier—more than 80 miles of water—separates Taiwan from the Chinese mainland, making any invasion far more complicated than Russia driving columns of tanks across the Ukrainian border in February 2022. Chinese troop-carrying ships and planes would be targeted by Taiwanese missiles, and initial casualties of any invading force are likely to be high.

The fact that Taiwan is an island, however, also makes securing ammunition and vital supplies, such as fuel to power its electricity plants, more complicated. The island’s small size—it occupies merely 6% of Ukraine’s surface area—provides little strategic depth should the Chinese military succeed in establishing some beachheads, as most wargames forecast will happen.

“For Taiwan, the situation is like David facing Goliath,” said Maj. Gen. Sun Li-fang, the spokesman for Taiwan’s military. “But this is our home country here, and the lifestyle of democracy and freedom is part of our values. We will protect it with whatever it takes.”

While the U.S. has no binding obligation to defend Taiwan and has long maintained a policy of strategic ambiguity on the issue, President Biden repeatedly cautioned that, unlike in Ukraine, the U.S. military would intervene directly should China attempt to seize the island by force. Before American troops deploy, however, the island would have to resist the first blows on its own. So far, despite recent improvements, it is far from ready, many U.S. officials and analysts say.

“The Taiwanese have to be committed 100%, because if they are not, there is no reason for the U.S. or any other nation to come to their aid,” said ret. U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula, dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies in Arlington, Va. “There needs to be a sense of urgency. America is not going to spill the blood of her sons and daughters over Taiwan if the Taiwanese are not willing to wholeheartedly prosecute the defense of their island and their people.”

> Taiwan’s military carried out live fire drills on the island’s southern coast on Monday, firing missiles from armored cars to destroy targets close to shore in a simulation of repelling invading forces.

While augmented over the past year, Taiwan’s military budget is still only 2.4% of the GDP—compared with well over 3% for the U.S., Poland’s 4% and about 5% in Israel. The professionalism and motivation of Taiwan’s military are a particular concern, Western officials say. The island’s main officer training school was originally established as Whampoa Military Academy in southern China in the 1920s, with heavy reliance on Soviet instructors. Outdated Soviet-style military culture and doctrine still persists in the ranks, defense analysts say. 

Despite the recent increase in the length of conscription, education deferrals mean that most draft-age Taiwanese won’t serve the entire year until 2028—and it remains unclear to what extent the current training of draftees, which according to many soldiers produces few useful skills, will be modernized. 

Currently, most draftees spend their time cleaning floors and picking weeds rather than learning how to repel Beijing’s People’s Liberation Army, said ret. Adm. Lee Hsi-min, a former chief of Taiwan’s military who has become a vocal critic of the island’s military preparedness. 

“If you just do the same things for a year instead of four months, then you have a problem and a bad reputation,” he said. “The problem is the training content, not the training period. How you do it is much more important than how long you do it.” The military says it is working to improve the training.
