Under Xi Jinping, he has had little chance to shine

At the opening of the annual session of China’s parliament on March 5th, the prime minister, Li Keqiang, will bow before nearly 3,000 delegates in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, before turning to bow again in the direction of the country’s supreme leader, Xi Jinping. He will then deliver his final state-of-the-nation speech, laced with tributes to Mr Xi. A few days later, Mr Li will be replaced. It will mark the end of a striking era in Chinese politics, when two men with very different family backgrounds, different networks and, seemingly, different worldviews held the two top jobs. After Mr Li, only Mr Xi’s men will have the limelight.

It is highly unlikely that anyone in the hall will openly muse about how different the country might have been if, instead of Mr Xi sitting at the centre of the dais, it had been Mr Li. Early this century it looked possible that it might turn out that way, with Mr Li—not Mr Xi—becoming paramount leader. Another remarkable feature of the past decade has been that a politician once seen as a strong contender for that role ended up serving as number two in the Communist Party hierarchy, showing little sign of resistance to the ever greater power that Mr Xi proceeded to amass at the expense of his own. It was not long after Mr Li took over as prime minister in 2013 that observers began to wonder whether his formal ranking overstated his authority.

The job of prime minister is often politically awkward in Communist-ruled China. It entails looking after the day-to-day running of government, usually with a focus on the economy. But the dividing line between this role and that of paramount leader is ill-defined. Tensions can ensue. Mao Zedong felt he had to draw his prime minister, Zhou Enlai, close “even as he raised the whip and sometimes lashed the man he could not live without”, wrote Gao Wenqian, a historian, in a biography of Zhou published in 2008. In the 1980s feuds between prime ministers and general secretaries grew rancorous; the pro-democracy upheaval of 1989 was fuelled by one.

But Mr Xi’s relationship with Mr Li has not been like Mao’s with Zhou. There has been little sign of dependence on Mr Li. On the contrary, Mr Xi, who became China’s leader in 2012, has sidelined him, leaning more heavily for economic advice on Liu He. In their teenage years, Mr Liu and Mr Xi were friends. Mr Liu became one of Mr Li’s deputies in 2018 and is about to retire, too.

Early last year rumours spread of a rift between Mr Li and Mr Xi. Some of Mr Li’s remarks appeared aimed at calming businesspeople who had been spooked by a regulatory clampdown on big non-state firms. Analysts wondered whether he was signalling disapproval of Mr Xi’s ideologically driven approach to economic management. In May Mr Li gave a televised speech to more than 100,000 officials, warning of dangers to the flagging economy and calling on them to work harder to boost growth. His emphasis seemed different from that of Mr Xi, who at the time was stressing the need to maintain stringent controls on the spread of covid-19.

At a five-yearly party congress in October, some observers were surprised when Mr Li stepped down from all of his party positions even though, at the age of 67, convention would have allowed him to remain on the Politburo Standing Committee. Even then, he was due to give up his post as prime minister at this month’s parliamentary session, having served the maximum of two terms. But he could have taken on another job, such as head of the legislature, the National People’s Congress.
