From America to New Zealand YIMBYs push market-led solutions

Flannery associates did not even have a website until the end of August. But a lawsuit involving the firm, first filed in a federal court in May, has uncovered the huge extent of its land holdings in Solano County, which lies around 60 miles (97km) north-east of San Francisco in California. The suit revealed that Flannery had committed to buying 140 properties for a total of more than $800m and was paying well over the market odds: as much as $15,000 per acre, for land valued to tax authorities for as little as a tenth of that. The entire scheme spans 50,000 acres, an area far larger than that of San Francisco proper.

Who would be willing to pay so much for seemingly so little? On August 25th the *New York Times* revealed that the formerly anonymous owners of Flannery Associates include almost a dozen Silicon Valley titans. Among them are Michael Moritz, former head of Sequoia Capital, a huge venture-capital firm, and Reid Hoffman, the founder of LinkedIn, a networking app. Though none of the land is currently zoned for housing, the plan, apparently, is to build a town from scratch. Its new website is branded “California Forever”, with architectural drawings of families eating in sunny Mediterranean-style plazas. This constitutes “a vision”, says Brian Brokaw of Flannery Associates.

Nowhere in the world is the failure to build enough housing clearer than in the San Francisco Bay Area. The overriding reason why boils down to Nimbyism, or “Not in My Backyard”, the tendency of locals to resist new development. A growing movement is trying to fix that. The secretive plans for a new city in Solano County are just one of the more outlandish strands of Yimbyism—a growing movement that says yes, not no, to development.

yimbys argue that housing shortages are caused largely by laws that control who can build what and where. Zoning and planning laws, they say, are so strict that building new housing is in many places completely illegal, and in almost all it is slow, difficult and expensive. In the past decade or so, Yimbyism has spread from a minority pursuit of economists and a few dedicated activists into a plausible political movement of its own, with thousands of members and chapters spreading across countries including America, Australia, Britain and New Zealand.

Not everyone agrees on everything. yimbys range from libertarian-leaning tech types through to self-described socialists, such as John Bauters. He is the bicycle-riding mayor of the tiny Californian city of Emeryville, who allows development because it gives him more rich people to tax. Yet all share one belief: more housing needs to be built, especially in the biggest and costliest cities.

## House of straw

In recent decades house prices have outstripped income growth across the developed world. The reasons for this are numerous. Interest rates affect how much buyers can afford, as does income growth. Population changes, culture and demography all have an impact on demand, as do bank regulation, lending practices and the like. But underlying it all is basic economic logic: where demand outpaces the supply of new homes, prices tend to rise.

According to data collated by Jim Gleeson, a researcher at the Greater London Authority, since the millennium the number of homes in English-speaking countries is lower relative to populations than elsewhere in the rich world, and growing more slowly, too. Between 2000 and 2020, the number of homes for every 100 people rose in Britain from 43 to 44. In America it went from 41 to 42, and in Australia from 40 to 41. In New Zealand population growth outpaced construction, and the number of homes per 100 residents fell slightly, to 38. In France by contrast, the figure was already 50 in 2000, and had risen to 55 by 2020; in Germany it went from 47 to 52, and in Japan from 42 to 49 (see chart 1).

What explains this? In most markets, higher prices stimulate supply. When demand for cars increases, carmakers open more factories. But all rich countries regulate construction, for good reason. Whereas a car can be manufactured and then transported almost anywhere, land is an inherently scarce resource, and for the most part housing is only valuable when it is near jobs, public services and infrastructure. Few people want to live right next door to a sewage plant; lots want to live near a large park. Planning is meant to take such things into account.

Because jobs move, a stable ratio of housing to people across a country can mask a growing shortage in the hottest local economies. In places like California and London, wages are far higher than elsewhere in America and Britain, and have risen faster in the past decade. But for workers who do not own property, the gains are eaten up by higher rents (see chart 2). Findings published in January by the National Bureau of Economic Research show that for workers with degrees, although living in a big coastal American city comes with a substantial wage premium, a higher cost of living means that overall they are about as well off as if they lived in a poorer city. Lower-skilled workers are much worse off, which means they move out to make space.
