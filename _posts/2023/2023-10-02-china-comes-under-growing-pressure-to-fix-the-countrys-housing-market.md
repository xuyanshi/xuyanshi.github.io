Pressure is building on Beijing to intervene more forcefully to restore confidence in its reeling [property market](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-property-real-estate-boom-covid-pandemic-bubble-11594908517?mod=article_inline).

In the latest sign of stress for the market, people with knowledge of Beijing’s decision-making said authorities are investigating whether Hui Ka Yan, the billionaire founder of heavily indebted property developer [China Evergrande Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/EGRNQ), attempted to transfer assets offshore while the company was struggling to complete unfinished projects.

The company [had disclosed an investigation](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-evergrande-shares-suspended-after-reports-of-founders-disappearance-3e5f4f8?mod=article_inline) into its founder last week, but offered little explanation. It didn’t respond to questions over the weekend.

Evergrande, whose plans to restructure [billions of dollars of debts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/evergrande-scraps-35-billion-restructuring-plan-as-chinas-housing-crisis-intensifies-5c2db979?mod=article_inline) have collapsed, is one of many property developers struggling to regain their footing three years after the popping of China’s housing bubble. As [bad news in the sector](https://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/does-chinas-property-bust-make-a-financial-crisis-inevitable-240f59d8?mod=article_inline) piles up, economists and investors are increasingly calling for more coordinated measures to restore confidence and help developers clear up their debts.

Ultimately, many say, it could require significant government intervention, much as the U.S. was forced to step in during the property-induced financial crisis in 2008.

“The government should take more decisive steps to clean up the troubled property sector, allowing losses to be allocated among developers, banks and other stakeholders,” said George Magnus, former chief economist of [UBS](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UBS) and an associate at Oxford University’s China center.

The deepening gloom over the property market, which in recent years made up as much as a quarter of China’s economy, [is threatening to offset recent improvements](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/chinas-economy-picks-up-steam-for-holiday-2d8b2fc?mod=article_inline) in manufacturing and other sectors, jeopardizing a hoped-for economic recovery.

Longer term, many economists warn, a prolonged property downturn could contribute to [an extended period of stagnation](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/is-chinas-economic-predicament-as-bad-as-japans-it-could-be-worse-aa962d0d?mod=article_inline) in China’s economy. That could spill over into the global economy in the form of weaker demand for commodities and depressed Chinese spending on items such as fashion from the U.S. and Europe.

Property investment in the year through August fell 8.8% versus the same period last year. Home sales by value by China’s top 100 developers declined 29% in September compared with a year earlier. [Other developers in trouble](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-economy-housing-country-garden-ea0db13f?mod=article_inline) include Country Garden, which once was considered among China’s healthiest.

“Property is a mess,” said Leland Miller, chief executive of the China Beige Book, an economic-research firm. “That’s why we’re seeing the dullest cyclical recovery in China ever.”

The State Council Information Office, which handles media inquiries for China’s leadership, didn’t immediately respond to questions. In the past, Chinese officials have said that Western politicians and media have exaggerated the country’s economic challenges, and that they are working to bring stability to the property industry.

To date, Chinese officials have mainly tried to muddle through the downturn. President Xi Jinping’s government has focused on modest steps to keep the market from falling apart, while holding off on addressing many of the worst problems.

Ad hoc efforts to make developers clean up their debts and finish stalled projects have met with only limited success. Other measures, such as [price floors imposed in many cities](https://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/china-has-second-thoughts-about-controlling-prices-in-its-multi-trillion-dollar-housing-market-f0a06012?mod=article_inline) to help keep home values stable, have masked the depths of the distress.

China’s real-estate troubles escalated to their current level in part because of decisions made earlier, when the leadership repeatedly leaned on housing to goose growth.

### ‘Grab the window’

Decades ago, most Chinese people lived in homes provided by their Communist Party work units. Authorities started liberalizing the market in the 1990s, setting off one of the biggest investment booms in history.

By the time Xi came to power in late 2012, a property bubble had already formed in many Chinese cities. Xi and his advisers at times tried to curb speculative activities.

But whenever growth appeared threatened, his leadership took steps to keep the property market humming. In Beijing policy-making circles, property became known as a countercyclical tool for economic management.

In 2015, with a housing glut dragging down prices, Beijing rolled out new policies to stimulate speculative buying and launched a slum-redevelopment program that expanded demand for private housing.

When the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020, authorities initially stood aside as the market took off again, inflating the bubble even more.
