Pressure is building on Beijing to intervene more forcefully to restore confidence in its reeling [property market](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-property-real-estate-boom-covid-pandemic-bubble-11594908517?mod=article_inline).

In the latest sign of stress for the market, people with knowledge of Beijing’s decision-making said authorities are investigating whether Hui Ka Yan, the billionaire founder of heavily indebted property developer [China Evergrande Group](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/EGRNQ), attempted to transfer assets offshore while the company was struggling to complete unfinished projects.

The company [had disclosed an investigation](https://www.wsj.com/world/china/china-evergrande-shares-suspended-after-reports-of-founders-disappearance-3e5f4f8?mod=article_inline) into its founder last week, but offered little explanation. It didn’t respond to questions over the weekend.

Evergrande, whose plans to restructure [billions of dollars of debts](https://www.wsj.com/articles/evergrande-scraps-35-billion-restructuring-plan-as-chinas-housing-crisis-intensifies-5c2db979?mod=article_inline) have collapsed, is one of many property developers struggling to regain their footing three years after the popping of China’s housing bubble. As [bad news in the sector](https://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/does-chinas-property-bust-make-a-financial-crisis-inevitable-240f59d8?mod=article_inline) piles up, economists and investors are increasingly calling for more coordinated measures to restore confidence and help developers clear up their debts.
