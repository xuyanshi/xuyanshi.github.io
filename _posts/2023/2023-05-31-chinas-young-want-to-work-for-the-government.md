Youth unemployment is now shockingly high

![jobs1](jobs1.jpg)

China is a land of remarkable statistics. But an official figure published on May 16th still managed to stand out. The unemployment rate among China’s [urban youth](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/04/20/what-chinas-graduates-really-think-about-their-job-prospects), aged between 16 and 24, exceeded one in five in April.

The figure boggles the mind for a variety of reasons. China is running short of [young people](https://www.economist.com/china/2023/05/25/small-town-chinese-officials-are-making-money-with-music-festivals). It is trying, without much success, to raise the birth rate. Its economic future hangs on increased education, which could improve the quality of its workers even as their quantity declines. China is also famous for mobilising resources, including manpower. Yet it is wasting large numbers of the best-educated cohort it has ever produced.

Youth unemployment is puzzling, as well as surprising. It has increased even as China’s economy has reopened after the sudden end of its zero-covid regime in December. It has jumped up while the overall unemployment rate has edged downwards (from 6.1% in April 2022 to 5.2% a year later). And it is likely to rise further in the next few months. This year, a record 11.6m students will graduate from university, an increase of almost 40% since 2019. They include Wang Lili, who will leave one of China’s top-100 universities this year with a degree in management. “The market is terrible,” she laments. “Many graduates are very anxious.”
